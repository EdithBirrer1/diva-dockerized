# DIVA.EXCHANGE Dockerized
Even if DIVA.EXCHANGE consists of several independent modules, it still should be rather simple to have the complete environment available.

## Get Started
To start the i2p/iroha testnet (3 nodes) execute:

`./bin/start-testnet.sh`

To stop the i2p/iroha testnet execute:

`./bin/halt-testnet.sh`
